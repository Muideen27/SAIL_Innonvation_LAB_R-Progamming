# About this session
In this session, we will undertake an hands-on session to learn R Shiny.

## Required Libraries
- library(tidyverse)

- library(shiny)

- Rtools

## Shiny R?
- Shiny is made by R Studio (Posit).

- Shiny is a platform for creating interactive R programs embedded into a web page.

- With Shiny, we can create simple, yet powerful, web-based interactive data products in R (time and initial dependency on designers).

- Following our sesssion on ML, letâ€™s say that you created a prediction algorithm. You can very easily create web input form that calls your prediction algorithm in R and displays the results (interactive data solution).

- When I was learning R, " ... it lacks the flexibility of full featured (and more complex) solutions".
