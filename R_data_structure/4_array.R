# Array
# Arrays are collections of matrices stacked on top of the other (homogeneous data structures). They are three dimensional.
# The array() can be used to create an array.
# array_name = array(data, dim, dimnames)

arr1 <- array(c(1:18), dim = c(2, 3, 3))
arr1

# The dimension(2, 3, 3) simply means 2 rows, 3 column and 3 matrix
