# grep documentation

### Alright, let's imagine that your computer is like a big library filled with books. Each book is like a file, and each page in the book is like a line of text inside that file. Now, suppose you're looking for a specific word or phrase in this library of books, and you want to find all the places where it appears. This is where our special helper, the "grep" command, comes in!

### The "grep" command is like a super-speedy librarian who can find any word or phrase you want in all the books (files) and show you exactly where they are.

Here are two examples to illustrate how "grep" works:

## Example 1: Finding a Word in a Single Book (File)


Imagine you have a book (file) called "story.txt" and you want to find the word "magic" in it. You would use "grep" like this:

## grep "magic" story.txt
